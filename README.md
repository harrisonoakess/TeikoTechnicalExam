# Cell Count Analysis Project

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing immune cell population data from biological samples, developed as a technical test for an internship. The goal is to process cell count data, calculate relative frequencies, and perform statistical comparisons to predict treatment responses in melanoma patients. It includes Python scripts for data processing and visualization, as well as database design concepts for scalable analytics.

## Repository Purpose
The repo provides a reproducible solution for converting cell counts to relative frequencies, generating boxplots, and analyzing treatment response differences, all tailored to a Unix-based system. It also outlines a database schema for managing large-scale biological sample data, showcasing skills for an internship evaluation.

## Instructions
